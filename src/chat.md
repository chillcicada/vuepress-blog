You are welcome to express your thoughts and comments freely in this space; however, it's expected that you should abide by the below agreement and regulations of this blog.

## Agreement

- This blog is only for personal use, and commercial use is not allowed and won't happen.
- Illegal acts and information are prohibited.
- Pluralistic values are allowed and accepted. But forced indoctrination of values to others is not allowed, especially for political purposes.

> The above agreement is a set of guidelines that all commentators are expected to adhere to.
>
> Any violation may result in measures such as collapsing or deleting comments.

## Additional regulations

I have no intent to establish this place as a spiritual sanctuary, so if you want to discuss relevant matters with me, it would be best for you to directly contact me via email ~~or in my other blog~~.

Also, best refrain from asking me any boundless questions as I am likely to provide no response.

## Comment System

This blog uses [Waline](https://waline.js.org) as the commenting system. It's a serverless commenting system based on [LeanCloud](https://leancloud.app). It's free and open-source.

Therefore, the blog system and comment system on this website are separate. It should be noted that logging in is not mandatory when commenting. However, if you want to register/login to a Waline account to comment and avoid logging in again in the future, it is recommended that you first set up your personal information on the [comment system](https://waline.chillcicada.com/ui) of this website after registering. This will help prevent unnecessary personal information leakage when using the default login method for that the window will automatically close instead of redirecting to the personal profile page after registering on Waline.
