## Additional regulations

I have no intent to establish this place as a spiritual sanctuary, so if you want to discuss relevant matters with me, it would be best for you to directly contact me via email ~~or in my other blog~~.

Also, best refrain from asking me any boundless questions as I am likely to provide no response.
